<h2>tradelink.afterlife</h3>
==========================

tradelink.afterlife is Dmitry's personal attempt to keep TradeLink (including ASP, Kadina etc. excluding lovely Glean) alive!
URL of the project: https://github.com/shevkoplyas/tradelink.afterlife

[Q] Project goals?
[A] To deliver a tool for implementing automated trading ideas (algotrading).

[Q] what can it do for me?
[A] For now "afterlife" edition of tradelink supports only one broker - Interactive Brokers (IB).
    If you have trading idea you and you can formalize it in C# code, then just download tradelink.afterlife, 
    compile the project, run it, connect to your IB account (real or paper),  then subscribe to one (or more)
    tickers. At this point your strategy will start getting tick data (well let call it IB's tick data) and 
    your strategy, written in C#, will have a chance to send some orders!  How cool is that!

[Q] Prerequisites?
[A] tradelink.afterlife is windows-based solution, so you'd have:
	- computer :)
	- Windows + MS Visual Studio able to compile C# and C++
	- experience in trading and software development (you can get those separately - it is ok:)
	- ib account
