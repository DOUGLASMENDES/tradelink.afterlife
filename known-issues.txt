This file describes known issues for tradelink.afterlife
--------------------------------------------------------

- when close ASP window there's still ASP process running in a background
  tmp workaround: run/stop ASP using visual studio (not by running compiled ASP.exe)

- when close ASP which runs response and response was subscribed to some real-time
  ticks, then TWSServer still holds the subscription for that ticker and sends
  GotTick() (to nowhere)
  Now, if you start ASP + response and try to subscribe to same ticker, then
  asp.cs::tl_gotTick() never fires (never receives ticks) and your response
  wont receive ticks (since ASP wont ever call response::GotTick())
  tmp workaround: restart both IB connector and ASP + response - solves it for now

- for "after hours" real time debug (after 16:00 EST) we need to subscribe to
  something actively trading 24/7, like forex CAD.JPY.
  ASP + response will not subscribe to forex ticker CAD.JPY because exchange
  is set by default is set to SMART instead of "IDEALPRO" for that ticker
  as well as security type defaults to STK instead of CASH for this case.
  tmp workaround (works only for CAD.JPY for now):
	C:\tradelink.afterlife\BrokerServers\TWSServer\TWS_TLServer.cpp
			if (sec.sym == "CAD.JPY"){
				contract.exchange = "IDEALPRO";//"SMART";
				//contract.secType = CASH;
				sec.type = TypeFromExchange(contract.exchange);
			}
  works!  :)
  note: when subscribing to CAD.JPY it is case sensitive, so "cad.jpy" won't fly
